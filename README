DISCLAIMER:
This is my crude attempt to implement some common graph algorithms.
I am very new to programming, and any comments/critiques will be welcome.
I'm using this "project" to become more familiar with C and git and github.

HOW TO USE:
To read in a graph, first convert it to the format described below, and save it
as a text file. Then pass the filename to read_graph, which returns a pointer
to a graph_t struct.

GRAPH FILE FORMAT:
n d     # n = number of vertices (>0), d = directed (1) or undirected (0)
u v w   # u, v are adjacent vertices, 0 <= u,v < n, w = weight of edge (any int)
u v w
...
u v w
(EOF)
